# moon
The program simulates the movement of Sun, Earth, Moon and n=BODIES planetoids
   It plots:
   the initial positions of all bodies
   the initial positions of n=5 first bodies (S, E, M and 2 planetoids)
   the trajectories of n=5 first bodies
   It detects collisions when a platetoid is closer than DIST_COLLISION to Moon
   It then plots
   a histogram of the angles of collisions
